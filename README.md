# KRACK: (K)ey (R)einstallation (A)tta(ck)

From the KRACK <a href="https://www.krackattacks.com/">website</a>:
> In a key reinstallation attack, the adversary tricks a victim into reinstalling an already-in-use key. This is achieved by manipulating and replaying cryptographic handshake messages. When the victim reinstalls the key, associated parameters such as the incremental transmit packet number (i.e. nonce) and receive packet number (i.e. replay counter) are reset to their initial value. Essentially, to guarantee security, a key should only be installed and used once. Unfortunately, we found this is not guaranteed by the WPA2 protocol. By manipulating cryptographic handshakes, we can abuse this weakness in practice.

***Unless a known patch has been applied, assume that all WPA2 enabled Wi-fi devices are vulnerable.***

## The Good
* Should a vendor take responsibility, devices are for the most part updatable.

## The Bad
* Many devices do not have an easy way to apply updates.
* A huge burden is placed on the consumer to keep their devices up to date
  * It may not be easy to search for all updates to all devices.
* The attack works for both clients and access points
  * Updating an access point does not keep clients protected!

## The Ugly
* Attacks against Android 6.0+ devices are very easy to accomplish.
  * It is advised to disable Wi-Fi and only use 4G for the time being.
* Updates may never come for many IoT devices.

### Attacks that can be made
* Adversary can decrypt arbitrary packets.
  * This allows an adversary to obtain the TCP sequence numbers of a connection, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_sequence_prediction_attack">hijack TCP connections</a>.
* Adversary can replay broadcast and multicast frames.
* Adversary can both decrypt and inject arbitrary packets. *(TKIP or GCMP ONLY)*
* Adversary can force the client into using a predictable all-zero encryption key. *(ANDROID 6.0+ and LINUX)*


### Attacks that cannot be made
* Adversary can not recover WPA password.
* Adversary can not inject packets. *(AES-CCMP ONLY)*

There is no need for our controller to get an update due to the leak itself, due to the massive lack of a GUI there is nothing at risk from our controller. <br/> From what I can see in my research and testing, KRACK vulnerability cannot potentially modify data on the network, or even eavesdrop from our controller. <br/> The absolute only thing at risk, after thorough testing, that a KRACK attacker would be able to *potentially* see is that you have a Rachio on your network. And even then, the only way they have the slightest ability to get any further would be via timing analysis, and even then it only would be your watering times."
